## Releasing

Releases are automated with
[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) from conventional
commits on `main`: it opens a release PR that bumps `package.json` and
`server.json`; merging it tags the release and publishes to npm and the MCP
registry.

Two one-time maintainer steps:

1. Add a `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` repository secret — a classic PAT with
   `contents:write` and `pull_requests:write`, so release-please PRs trigger CI.
2. Publish the package to npm once by hand (`npm publish --access public`), then
   configure a **trusted publisher** for this repository on npmjs.com so later
   releases publish without a token.
